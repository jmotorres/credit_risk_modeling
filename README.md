# Credit Risk Modeling

This data science project focuses on credit risk assessment using typical data collected by banks and lending institutions. In this project, I systematically explored client financial profiles and loan details to identify key factors that distinguish high-risk borrowers. Further, I created and validated a machine learning model to predict borrower repayment behavior. Ultimately, I hope this project can serve as a guide for developing viable and profitable lending strategies through a data-driven approach.

## Project Structure

The project workflow was divided into 4 sections
- Data Preparation: Data wrangling and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization: Visualization of variable frequencies, distributions, and 1-to-1 correlation analysis
- Model Building, Tuning, and Evaluation: Linear regression analysis and predictive modeling using Random Forest
- Real World Application (Earnings Computations): Simulation and optimization of profit using a risk-tiering strategy in conjunction with the trained model
